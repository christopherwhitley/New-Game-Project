  sentences:
  - Ah, another wanderer through these parts. Be sure to visit the stores here for
    gear and weapons.
  - Where am I headed? I'm...not sure. I was drawn to this place for some reason.
    As if there's something here that belongs to me.
  - If you spot anything that could belong to an Elven archer do bring it my way,
    won't you?
